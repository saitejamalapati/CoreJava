# Core Java Assignment
This project is about simulating a telephone using java classes.<br><br>
I created three classes and two interfaces.<br><br>
### The three classes are Mobile, Call and Contact.<br>
### The two interfaces are Call_Interface and Contact_Interface.<br><br><br>
Initially the user needs to provide his details like name, phone number, etc.<br><br>
We can create new contacts and save them, view all contacts, delete a contact and search for a particular contact.<br><br>
We can make a call to existing contact, dail a new number and make a call to it. While dailing a number it checks if you are trying to dail to your own number.<br><br>
We can view the call history in descending order i.e., the latest call is shown first.<br><br><br>

## Latest features will be rolling out soon enough!!!
